This project posts subscribed author's blog entries as Joomla articles
to create a blog-planet-like section on your site which you can then
present as a regular Joomla Category and link to site contents using
mod_related or any other module.

I. Introduction

This script is meant to be set up as a cron job to do the following
tasks:

	- Read all subscribed feeds to see what new posts were added
	  since last time it ran.
	- Insert new unpublished articles for each new post into a Joomla
	  database using the post title and the content.
	- Collect all post titles and descriptions (in case there's no
	  description, the first paragraph is used) and send an e-mail to
	  all subscribed administrators to notify the new articles.

II. Dependencies

2.1 Universal Feed Parser

This script depends on Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser, which you
can get from your package manager (feedparser Python module) or from

http://www.feedparser.org 

***IMPORTANT NOTICE***

Current stable version of Universal Feed Parser (4.1) has a bug at
processing Wordpress feeds, see

http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/issues/detail?id=112

2.2 MySQL Python Module

Currently the script is only able to connect to MySQL Joomla databases
and uses the MySQL Python module which you can get from your package
manager.

III. Installation

Select an existing category or create a new one where to put all
articles from post and annotate the category id and the section id
for that category. You must also select or create a user which
will appear as the creator of the article and annotate its id.

Update config.py with your information and add all ids annotated
from the previous paragraph under the Various ids section. Note
that the script doesn't need to run on the same server as the
Joomla installation and you should update the smtpServer variable
to your preferred e-mail server which may be your localhost or a
relay server.

You can then setup a cron job to run the script automatically.
